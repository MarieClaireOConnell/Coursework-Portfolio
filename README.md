# ðŸ“š Coursework Portfolio
Thank you for visiting my GitHub profile!

Some of my completed coursework from the University of Washington's Master of Science in Information Management (MSIM) program is kept private to uphold academic integrity and respect course policies.

If you are a potential employer, collaborator, or reviewer and would like to see samples of my academic work â€” including projects, papers, or technical assignments â€” I would be happy to provide access upon request.

ðŸ”¹ To request access, please contact me via LinkedIn or email me at marieo3@uw.edu.

Thank you for your interest!
